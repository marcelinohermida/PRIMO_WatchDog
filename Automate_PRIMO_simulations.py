AutomatePRIMOsimulations


v1.10: added gamma criteria defined by user in CONFIG.DOG file. MH. 1/11/23.

v1.09_para_GitHub: no new functionalities. Simplifications for Github.
                   Quiron edition removed. MH. 8/10/23.

v1.09: added gamma criteria 3%/1mm global with threshold 10%, only for 
       QUIRON. Opens all gamma analyses PDF reports. 1/11/22. MH.

v1.08: added conditions to detect if CT was acquired or if it's a virtual 
       phantom in TPD. Uses "KVP" DICOM tag. 23/2/22. MH.

v1.07: bug in Analyze_simulation_results fixed. Changed pattern "\RP." and 
       "\CT." to "\RP" and "\CT". 15/2/22. MH.

v1.06: Bug: "Dose planning" in ManufacturerModelName doesn't guarantee plan 
       is from Elements MBM. 14/2/22. MH.

v1.05: Deletes original PDF and txt reports to avoid duplicates. Opens PDF 
       after simulation. Adds plan technique (3DCRT, VMAT, etc). Considers 
       if CT is from a virtual phantom in macro. 13/2/22. MH.

v1.04: Bug with setup fields fixed. If HyperArc plan detected and QUIRON = 
       YES, full PSF is used, ignoring factor in CONFIG.DOG. Gamma criteria 
       added to CONFIG but not operative yet. 24/1/22. MH.

v1.03: Add "# SEND TELEGRAM" in CONFIG.DOG. Removes "#" from plan name. 
       Added "# QUIRON". New parameters in CSV: linac_ID, TPS, TPS version.
       MH. 22-1-22.

v1.02: Implements recursive watchdog: works with DICOM files or folder 
       containing them. 29-12-21.

v1.01: Implements independent threading for multiple simulations. Uses PID 
       of PRIMO process to close it. 28-12-2021.

v1.00: v0.11 renamed to v1.00. Adapted to PRIMO 0.3.64.1816 (customized by 
       Miguel Rodr√≠guez). Previous versions for PRIMO 0.3.64.1814. PDFs use 
       dates. Simulation and gamma analyses results in csv. 27-12-2021. MH.

v0.10: Minor robustness improvements. Works in Dell-MH and laptop. If DICOM 
       files exist, they're overwritten. If project folder exists, it's 
       recreated. If segmentation file change fails, continues with default.
       Analysis of results WIP. Dec 18, 2021. MH.

v0.09: modifies segmentation file on-the-fly. Option in CONFIG.DOG for 
       REDUCED or ORIGINAL CT resolution. Fraction of PSF histories can be 
       simulated. New gamma criteria: 2%/2 mm. Dec 8, 2021. MH.

v0.08: Log capability added. Reads nominal energy and fluence mode (FF or 
       FFF) correctly. Nov 21, 2021. MH.

v0.07: Try-except for Telegram messages (doesn't work from hospital). 
       Changed to format x.xx. Nov 9, 2021. MH.

v0.6: Minor improvements.

v0.5: Same as v 0.4. Added splash screen. Nov 07 2021. MH.

v0.4: Reads MORE config parameters from config file. Nov 06 2021. MH.

v0.3: Reads config parameters from config file. Nov 02 2021. MH.

v0.2: Created on Nov 01 2021.
